## Description

No more endless sheets of paper to record guests information. Switch to a more efficient process. With Django-Guests, organizations can track guests in real time, as they enter and leave the office premises. Search for guests easily and see ther data and duration they spent within the premise. The welcome experience is improved as well as security because only defined users (based on access and authorization) can have access to Guests data. 

## Features

Here are what makes the project tick! Please go through the features to see why this project is awesome!

- Simple Dashboard
    - This is the landing page for all authenticated users. However, users would be directed to the login page when they are not authenticated. 
    - You can add customizations to change the looks of the dashboard to suit your taste. 
- Search Functionality
    - Want to checkout a particular guest? All you have to do is search for the guest with either firstname or surname and you get the result in real time. 
    - The search func also uses the Q algorithm and API that comes inbuilt in django. This improves speed and search results accuracy. 
- User Authentication
    - All users on the app would have to authenticated and authorized before adding, updating or retrieving guests records. 
- Default Message Framework Integration
    - This only improves the user's experience by letting them know the outcome of the operations that they've completed within the applicaition.
- .CSV file export
    - You can back up your data by exporting into a CSV file and storing locally or in the cloud
